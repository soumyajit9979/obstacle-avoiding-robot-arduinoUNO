# obstacle-avoiding-robot-arduinoUNO
Made a robot with the help of arduino that can avoid any obstacle that turns in different direction when any obstacle in front of it, it has a ultrasonic sensor in front of it, which will avoid any obstacle when distance is less than 30 cm in front of it, it will have a servo motor attached below the ultrason sensor, which on detecting obstacle will turn by 90 degrees on both the direction to check the distance in both right and left, and will turn in the direction where the disctance is more, and will start moving in the front direction
